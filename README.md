# The Stability of Conditional Cooperation (Andreozzi, Ploner, Saral) 
## About this repository 
This repository contains the supplementary files for the study:

Andreozzi, Luciano, Matteo Ploner, and Ali Seyhun Saral. "The Stability of Conditional Cooperation: Beliefs Alone Cannot Explain the Decline of Cooperation in Social Dilemmas"

The reposiotory contains z-Tree files to run the experiment, the data, and the R codes for the data analysis. The figures and the tables can be reproduced using the scripts in the repository. The repository also contains a `zBrac` compatible treatment file and the language template for easy translation/replication of the experiment. (For more information about the zBrac project [click here for the project repository](https://www.github.com/seyhunsaral/zbrac))

The data (`/data`) are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 international license, and z-Tree (`/ztree`) and R codes(`/code`) are licensed under MIT license. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the license details.

## Repository Contents
### code
 * `functions.R` : Contains the functions that are used for the analysi 
 * `main.R` : This file reproduces the figures and the tables in the paper.
 * `process_raw_data.R`: This file takes the raw data in `./data/rawdata/` folder and produces CSV and RDS files for the analysis. The repository already contains the cleaned-up data files (CSV and RDS). However these files are available only for the sake of reproduction.
 
### data
 
#### csv
 Generated by `process_raw_data.R`. 
 * `decbehav.csv`: Subjects' interactions with the interface is recorded here. Not used for the analysis
 * `quest.csv`: Post-experiment questionnaire data
 * `subjects.csv`: Main data file
 
#### rawdata
 This folder contains raw data of each session as the output generated by z-Tree.
 
#### rds
 Generated by `process_raw_data.R`. R Data Tables in R Object form. Used for the analysis. The advantage of those files over the CSV files is that they contain the data types of each column as well. For the definitions see `csv` section above.
 * `decbehav.csv`
 * `quest.csv`
 * `subjects.csv`
 
### figs
 Empty folder for the figures to be generated by `main.R`
 
### ztree
 * `condcoop_english.txt`: English version of the main experiment. Created with. `zBrac`. Should be imported by z-Tree.
 * `cond_coop_zbrac_language_template.xlsx` Language file for the zBrac. It can be edited and used with `condcoop_zbrac.txt` to generate the experiment in other languages.
 * `condcoop_zbrac.txt`: `zBrac` The source file. It can be used to generate treatment files in different languages.
 #### original-italian
 Contains the original z-Tree files in Italian language
 * `1_control_questions.ztt` : Control questions
 * `2_condcoop.ztt`: Experiment
 * `3_quest.ztq`: Questionnaire

## Reproduction 
* To reproduce the figures and tables, the script `main.R` should be executed. That would print out the tables on the console and create figures in the folder `figs`.

* To reproduce the data cleaning process, the script `process_raw_data.R` should be run. That would recreate the data in `csv` and `rds` folders.

On major operating systems, it can be done through the command line as the following (given that the R software and the dependencies are installed).
```
Rscript process_raw_data.R
Rscript main.R 
```

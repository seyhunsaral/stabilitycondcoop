# The Stability of Conditional Cooperation (Andreozzi, Ploner, Saral) 

This repository contains the files for the study: the data, R code, and z-Tree files. 
It also includes a zBrac compatible treatment file and the language template for easy translation. (To find more information about zBrac [click here](https://www.github.com/seyhunsaral/zbrac))

## Files in this repository
### code
 * `functions.R` : Contains functions that is used in other files 
 * `main.R` : This file reproduces figures and the tables in the paper.
 * `process_raw_data.R`: This file takes the raw data in `./data/rawdata/` folder and produces CSV and RDS files for the analysis. The repository already containes cleaned-up data. Only for the sake of reproduction.
 
 ### data
 
 #### csv
 Generated by `process_raw_data.R`. CSV files are for those who like to use other software than `R`. Not used in the analysis
 * `decbehav.csv`: Each subjects interaction with the interface is recorded here. Not used for the analysis
 * `quest.csv`: Post-experiment questionnaire data
 * `subjects.csv`: Main data file
 
 #### rawdata
 This folder contains raw data of each session.
 
 #### rds
 Generated by `process_raw_data.R`. R Data Tables in R Object form. Used for the analysis. The advantage of those files over the CSV files that they contain the data types of each column as well. For the definitions see `csv` section above.
 * `decbehav.csv`
 * `quest.csv`
 * `subjects.csv`
 
 ### figs
 This empty folder is for the figures to be generated by `main.R`
 
 ### ztree
 * `condcoop_english.txt`: English version of the main experiment. Created with. `zBrac`. Should be imported with z-Tree.
 * `cond_coop_zbrac_language_template.xlsx` Language file for the zBrac. It can be edited and used with `condcoop_zbrac.txt` to generate the experiment in other languages.
 * `condcoop_zbrac.txt`: `zBrac` source file. It can be used to generate treatment files in different languages.
 #### original-italian
 Contains original z-Tree files in Italian Language
 * `1_control_questions.ztt` 
 * `2_condcoop.ztt`
 * `3_quest.ztq`
